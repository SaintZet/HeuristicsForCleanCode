public class MoogDiver 
{
    private Gradient _gradient;
    private List<Spline> _splines;
    
    public void Dive(string reason) 
    {
        SaturateGradient();
        ReticulateSplines();
        DiveForMoog(reason);
    }
    ...
}

//The order of the three functions is important. You must saturate the gradient before you can reticulate the splines,
//and only then can you dive for the moog. Unfortunately, the code does not enforce this temporal coupling.
//Another programmer could call reticulateSplines before saturateGradient was called, leading to an UnsaturatedGradientException.

// A better solution is:

public class MoogDiver 
{
    private Gradient _gradient;
    private List<Spline> _splines;
    
    public void dive(string reason) 
    {
        Gradient _gradient = SaturateGradient();
        List<Spline> _splines = ReticulateSplines(gradient);
        DiveForMoog(_splines, reason);
    }
    ...
}

// This exposes the temporal coupling by creating a bucket brigade.
// Each function produces a result that the next function needs, so there is no reasonable way to call them out of order.

//You might complain that this increases the complexity of the functions, and youâ€™d be right.
//But that extra syntactic complexity exposes the true temporal complexity of the situation.

//Note that I left the instance variables in place. I presume that they are needed by private methods in the class.
//Even so, I want the arguments in place to make the temporal coupling explicit.
